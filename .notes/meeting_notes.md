# 2026-07-16 — Phase 0 audit execution

## Decisions

- Raise coverage gate to 70% (not jump straight to 80%) to keep CI green while closing P0 gaps; 75/80 tracked as P0-9.
- State SoT documented in ADR 0001 (Redux + Dexie; PresetContext exception; local App stream state).
- Security automation in separate `security.yml` to avoid blocking Pages deploy on CodeQL latency.
- pnpm audit remains `--audit-level=high` in deploy path; moderate tightening deferred with manual review (avoid surprise CI red).
- **English-only** for new repo content (docs, comments, commits, default strings) — `.cursor/rules/010-english-content.mdc`.

## Impact

- New libs under `src/lib/` are in Vitest coverage include and lift aggregate %.
- KB deletes now sync Redux entities (data-integrity fix).
